**My Neovim Configuration :**


This configuration is partially based on the setup by Hendrik Mi (https://github.com/hendrikmi).
I have added custom configurations for auto-session management and STM32 Cortex-M debugging.

-- Plugins and Keymaps

---

-- Plugins are managed using a plugin manager (e.g., packer.nvim, lazy.nvim).
-- Keymaps are optimized for productivity and ease of use.

## **Leader Key**

The leader key is set to `<Space>`. This key is used as a prefix for many custom keybindings.

```lua
vim.g.mapleader = ' '
vim.g.maplocalleader = ' '
```
